        1Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyze the Resume and Job Description**: Identify all key skills, technologies, and job expectations.
        2Ô∏è‚É£ **Match Job Description with Candidate‚Äôs Experience**: Instead of adding generic points, modify and enhance the resume **based on past projects** that align with the JD.
        3Ô∏è‚É£ **Integrate All JD Points Naturally**: Ensure that all job description requirements are reflected in the resume, either by **modifying existing points** or **adding new relevant points**.
        4Ô∏è‚É£ **Project-Specific Enhancements**: When adding new points, reference **specific projects, technologies, or achievements** from the resume that align with the JD.
        5Ô∏è‚É£ **Maintain Format & Length**: Keep the structure, number of pages, and bullet points consistent. Ensure no section is removed, but only enhanced.
        6Ô∏è‚É£ **Use Industry-Specific Language**: Adapt the wording to match how professionals in the industry would describe the same experience.
        7Ô∏è‚É£ **Avoid Repetition**: Do not duplicate points; instead, refine existing descriptions to match the JD requirements more effectively.
        8Ô∏è‚É£ **Ensure Measurable Impact**: Wherever possible, add quantifiable achievements (e.g., "Improved application performance by 30% by optimizing SQL queries").`

        üîπ **Instructions for Enhancing the ${section} Section**:
        1Ô∏è‚É£ **Identify Matching JD Requirements**: Extract relevant skills and qualifications from the JD.
        2Ô∏è‚É£ **Modify Existing Points**: Instead of simply adding new points, refine and enhance existing descriptions to better reflect the JD.
        3Ô∏è‚É£ **Use Past Projects for Context**: Ensure any new additions reference past projects that match the JD.
        4Ô∏è‚É£ **Keep Bullet Point Count the Same**: If the section originally had 8 bullet points, the updated version should have 8 or more, but never fewer.
        5Ô∏è‚É£ **Preserve Formatting & Industry Standards**: Maintain consistent font, spacing, and bullet styles.
